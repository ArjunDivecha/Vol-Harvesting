Abstract
Volatility isn’t just a measure of market fluctuations; it is the underlying asset of
a large number of tradable instruments. After a concise overview of the history
of volatility trading, this paper shows how individual investors can construct port-
folios that aim to capture the volatility risk premium using nothing more than
VIX-linked exchange-traded notes (ETNs). We test four rule sets, beginning with
a constant short-volatility allocation and ending with a dynamically sized strategy
that responds to both the option-market premium and the slope of the VIX term
structure. Over 2008-2025, and after realistic costs, the final version compounds at
16.3% per year, delivers a Sharpe ratio of 1, and keeps equity-market correlation
near 15%. Blending even a modest slice of this strategy into a passive SPY portfolio
can lift the combined Sharpe ratio by 20%. We also outline how the rules can be
automated through a standard broker API. In conclusion, volatility trading is no
longer the exclusive domain of institutional hedge funds. With the right tools and
discipline, individual investors and systematic traders can now access and exploit
volatility-based strategies. However, one must always be mindful: volatility itself
is volatile—and should be handled with care.

1 Introduction
Most investors place directional bets: they try to guess where prices will go—up if they
buy, down if they short. Volatility traders care far less about direction; they bet on how
much prices will move, no matter which way the market ultimately drifts. In practice,
that means trying to buy volatility when it is considered cheap (usually when the crowd
is calm and optimism dominates the narrative) or to sell volatility when market partic-
ipants are willing to overpay for it (usually when fear dominates and investors want to
hedge their portfolios). Directional trades need a correct view of the direction of the
move; volatility trades need the market to move either more or less than what is already
priced into options.
Over the last 50 years, volatility has evolved from a theoretical byproduct of option
pricing models into a fully tradable asset class. Today, investors can take directional or
relative views on volatility using a wide range of instruments, including exchange-traded
products linked to the VIX futures curve. Yet while volatility trading is increasingly
accessible, extracting consistent returns from it remains far from trivial.
This paper investigates how individual investors can create exposure to the famous volatil-
ity risk premium (VRP)—the tendency of implied volatility to exceed realized volatil-
ity—using only publicly listed VIX-linked ETNs. We focus on strategies that do not
require options expertise, margin leverage, or institutional infrastructure, and evaluate
their performance across nearly two decades of market history.
We construct four rule-based strategies that progressively increase in sophistication:
1. A passive short-volatility position,
2. A strategy that times exposure using the expected VRP,
3. A dual-signal approach that adds information from the VIX term structure, and
4. A dynamically sized version that adjusts risk based on VIX levels.
All strategies are tested on a realistic dataset from January 2008 through May 2025, using
conservative assumptions for transaction costs and signal timing.
Our findings suggest that even simple filters can meaningfully improve the risk-adjusted
2

returns of passive volatility exposure, and that a thoughtfully constructed volatility sleeve
can offer both positive alpha and low correlation to equities.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
•Section 2 presents the background and stylized facts that motivate our approach,
including a short history of volatility trading, the emergence of VIX-linked products,
and key empirical features of the volatility risk premium.
•Section 3 outlines the data sources and backtesting assumptions, including how we
build investable proxies for VIX ETNs and structure realistic execution logic.
•Section 4 details the construction of four increasingly sophisticated strategies, from
a passive short-volatility position to a dual-signal model with dynamic sizing.
•Section 5 presents the performance results, including risk-adjusted metrics, draw-
downs, turnover, and how the strategy behaves across market regimes. We also
explore the impact of combining the strategy with traditional equity portfolios.
•Section 6 outlines how the strategy can be automated via broker APIs.
•Section 7 concludes with key takeaways and suggestions for further research.
•In the appendix ( Appendix A ), we provide a curated list of papers, books, and other
useful resources for readers interested in exploring the topics discussed in greater
depth.
We have deliberately chosen not to include a formal literature review in the main body
of the paper, in order to keep the reading experience accessible to non-academic audiences.
Disclaimer : While this study presents a comprehensive analysis of volatility trading strategies using
VIX-linked exchange-traded notes (ETNs), all results are derived from historical backtests. As such,
they reflect past market dynamics and should not be interpreted as guarantees of future performance.
The profitability and robustness of the proposed approach are inherently dependent on the persistence
of volatility risk premium and the structure of the VIX derivatives market—factors that may evolve
over time. Readers and investors should remain mindful that future outcomes may differ substantially
from those observed in this retrospective evaluation.

2 Background and Stylized Facts
The path to modern volatility trading began with mathematician Edward O. Thorp,1
who spent the early 1960s studying stock warrants—effectively long-dated call options
written on a particular firm. By building a formula that resembled what would later
become the Black-Scholes framework, Thorp realised many warrants were overpriced; he
shorted them and hedged with the underlying stock to extract the premium. His un-
published formula anticipated the celebrated 1973 papers by Fischer Black and Myron
Scholes, and by Robert C. Merton, which generalized option pricing and demonstrated
that, under specific market assumptions, an option’s payoff can be replicated by contin-
uously rebalancing a portfolio consisting of a risk-free bond and a dynamic position in
the underlying stock (or index).
In April 1973, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) opened its doors, bringing
options out of the opaque, illiquid over-the-counter market and into a regulated, transpar-
ent trading venue. This marked the beginning of modern volatility trading. Speculators
quickly developed a range of methods to bet not just on the direction of prices, but on
how much prices would move, i.e., volatility. A simple way to take a view on volatility is
to buy or sell individual calls or puts. More sophisticated strategies involve constructing
a portfolio of options and continuously hedging it with the underlying asset. For example,
to go long volatility, one might buy a call option and dynamically short the underlying
stock—not to bet on direction, but to isolate exposure to the difference between implied
and realized volatility.
While elegant in theory, these delta-hedged option strategies come with practical chal-
lenges. Sudden price jumps, transaction costs, gaps in market liquidity, and path depen-
dency can undermine profitability, making it difficult for traders to harvest the volatility
risk premium (VRP).
To address these limitations, banks introduced variance swaps in the mid-1990s. These
are over-the-counter contracts on the difference between the realized variance of an as-
set’s returns over a fixed horizon and a pre-agreed strike. Unlike traditional option
1Thorp is also well known for his groundbreaking book Beat the Dealer (1962), where he applied
probability theory to the game of blackjack. His card-counting system was the first mathematically sound
method proven to give players an edge over the house, making him a pioneer not only in quantitative
finance but also in applied game theory.

strategies, variance swaps offer pure exposure to volatility without the need to manage
a complex hedge or rebalance positions. For the investor, the mechanics are simple: the
bank delivers a single payoff at maturity based on realized variance2. All the intricate
replication—typically involving a strip of out-of-the-money options—is handled by the
dealer. In other words, the investor trades volatility directly, without needing to worry
about constructing the hedge themselves.
Much of the theoretical groundwork behind variance swaps was laid by academics and
practitioner-quants. Notably, Peter Carr, Roger Lee, Emanuel Derman, and Bruno
Dupire contributed key insights into how variance exposure can be replicated using vanilla
options. Their work helped formalize the pricing models used by dealers and enabled
broader adoption of variance-based products in institutional portfolios.
The most actively quoted variance swap is written on the S&P 500 and allows investors
to exchange the index’s realized variance over the next 30 days for a pre-agreed strike
price. This strike is directly linked to the VIX Index. In fact, the square of the VIX Index
represents the fair strike of the variance swap. This makes the VIX—or more precisely,
the formula behind it—not just a fear gauge, but also a cornerstone of modern volatility
trading instruments.
To make things concrete, consider a hypothetical example involving the S&P 500. Sup-
pose it’s the last business day of the month, and the VIX Index closes at 20. This implies
that the fair strike of a 30-day variance swap is 202= 400. In other words, the market is
pricing in an annualized realized volatility of 20% over the next 30 calendar days. Now
imagine that over the next month, market conditions worsen and the realized volatility
of the S&P 500 turns out to be 30% annualized. That corresponds to 302= 900 variance
points. A trader who had bought variance—betting that actual volatility would exceed
expectations—would receive the difference:
Payoff = Notional ×(900−400) = Notional×500 (1)
This cash-settled payout is delivered by the bank without any need for the investor to
2Although the contract pays out only at maturity, it is re-valued each day via a mark-to-market
mechanism. Each party’s unrealized profit or loss is computed based on realized variance to date plus the
implied variance of the remaining period, keeping the swap’s net present value near zero. When exposure
exceeds predefined thresholds, variation margin is exchanged daily to restore collateral balances. This
ensures that gains and losses are settled incrementally rather than accumulated until maturity.

manage option hedges or rebalance exposures. All that matters is how much the S&P
500 actually moved during the life of the swap. Conversely, an investor who had sold
variance would face a loss of 500 times the notional. This simple structure gives traders
a clean and scalable way to express views on future equity market volatility.
Because volatility tends to spike when equities fall3, many portfolio managers use in-
struments such as variance swaps to obtain downside insurance. While the options mar-
ket must clear in every trade, the pool of risk-averse investors seeking this protection
persistently exceeds the pool of counterparties willing to warehouse volatility risk. In
equilibrium, option writers therefore require a systematic premium, and option-implied
volatility tends to stand above the volatility that is eventually realized. The resulting
gap is referred to as the volatility risk premium (VRP).
Figure 1 illustrates this persistent pattern. The blue line shows the VIX Index, the mar-
ket’s forecast of S&P 500 volatility over the next 30 days, while the red line tracks the
realized volatility that unfolded over that same horizon. Between 2005 and 2025, the
VIX overestimated realized volatility roughly 80% of the time, with an average premium
of about 2.5 volatility points.4
However, during sharp market corrections—such as the Global Financial Crisis (2008),
the European debt crisis (2011), the Volmageddon event (2018), the COVID-19 shock
(2020), and the recent tariff war escalation (2025)—realized volatility surged past the
VIX, leading to losses for investors who had sold volatility. The bottom panel of Figure 1
shows the realized volatility risk premium in volatility points (i.e., the difference between
the VIX and the subsequent 30-day realized volatility), highlighting both the steady pre-
mium observed during calm periods and the sharp reversals that occur during volatility
spikes.
3This statistical fact is known as the Leverage Effect—a tendency for volatility to rise following
negative returns. First documented by Black (1976) and Christie (1982), it is a well-established feature
of equity markets and major stock indices. However, this behavior does not generalize across all asset
classes: in many commodity markets (e.g., oil, gas, and agricultural products), an inverse leverage effect
is often observed—volatility tends to increase after price rises.
4Consistent with prevailing dealer practice in the one-month S&P 500 variance-swap market, we apply
a 5 % haircut to the quoted VIX level before comparison. In pricing terms, the variance-swap strike K
is typically quoted such that√
K≈0.95×VIX, reflecting fees, discretisation effects, and a convexity
adjustment.

While pure variance swaps remain primarily an institutional instrument, due to their
over-the-counter (OTC) nature, large notional sizes, and counterparty credit require-
ments, volatility trading became more accessible when the Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE)
introduced VIX futures on March 26, 2004.
A VIX future (ticker: VX) reflects the market’s consensus forecast of where the VIX
Index will settle at the contract’s expiration. These are cash-settled contracts, with each
VIX index point worth $1,000. This means that a one-point change in the futures price
translates into a $1,000 gain or loss per contract.5
The main monthly VIX futures expire on the third Wednesday of each month.6On ex-
piration day, the VIX futures settle at the level of the VIX Index.7
Holding a VIX future until expiry is thus a directional bet on where the VIX Index will
print on that day. For example, suppose an investor buys one VIX future at 16 when
VIX is quoting at 15, anticipating a rise in the price of volatility. At expiry, if the VIX
Index settles at 18, the contract settles at 18, resulting in a profit of:
(18−16)×$1,000 = $2,000 (2)
Conversely, if the VIX finishes at 14, the investor incurs a $2,000 loss. The simplicity of
the P&L calculation and the centralized clearing structure make VIX futures an efficient
vehicle for trading short-term volatility expectations.
As discussed, the VIX futures price reflects the market’s best estimate of where the VIX
Index will settle at expiration. Consequently, the profit or loss on a short VIX futures
position depends entirely on the actual VIX level observed at expiry.
5In August 2020, the Cboe introduced Mini VIX Futures (ticker: VXM), which are one-tenth the size
of the standard contract. Each index point is worth $100, making these instruments more accessible to
retail traders and smaller institutions seeking exposure to volatility with lower capital requirements.
6More precisely, the contract settles on the Wednesday that is 30 calendar days before the third Friday
of the following month. If that Wednesday or the relevant Friday is a Cboe holiday, settlement moves to
the preceding business day.
7More precisely, the Cboe calculates a Special Opening Quotation (SOQ) for the VIX on expiration
day. This value is based on a weighted average of opening prices of a wide strip of out-of-the-money S&P
500 (SPX) options that expire exactly 30 calendar days later. The SOQ serves as the final settlement
price for expiring VIX futures and options contracts.

This raises two important questions:
1. If the VIX Index itself tends to overstate future realized volatility, do VIX futures
also systematically overestimate future VIX levels?
2. If so, is the traditional VRP ( VRP t=VIX t−30−RVt−30,t) related with what we’ll
refer to as the VIX Futures Risk Premium ( VFRP t=VXt−30−VIX t)?
These questions are highly relevant. If a persistent premium exists in VIX futures similar
to that in variance swaps, then investors without access to OTC variance swap markets
may still be able to capture the volatility risk premium by trading VIX futures or related
instruments. In other words, VIX futures may serve as a practical proxy for variance
exposure, offering an accessible alternative path to expressing views on volatility pricing
inefficiencies.
To address these questions, we constructed a synthetic 30-day VIX futures contract
(VX30), for every trading day from January 2005 through May 2025. For each day
in the sample, we compared the VX30 value to the actual VIX Index level observed 30
calendar days later. The difference between these two figures is what we define here as
the VIX Futures Risk Premium (VFRP).8
Figure 2 provides visual evidence for the existence of a risk premium in VIX futures. In
the top panel, the green line shows the level of the synthetic VX30 contract—our proxy
for a 30-day VIX future—while the blue line shows the actual VIX Index value 30 calen-
dar days later. The two lines tend to move closely together, but the green line (VX30)
often sits slightly above the blue line, indicating a consistent premium.
The bottom panel of Figure 2 plots the VIX Futures Risk Premium (VFRP)—calculated
as the simple difference between the VX30 and the future VIX Index level—over time. A
positive VFRP implies that VIX futures were overpriced relative to the subsequent VIX
realization; a negative VFRP indicates the opposite.
8A simpler alternative would have been to analyze the historical P&L of actual VIX futures contracts
with varying time-to-expiration (e.g., from 1 to 90+ days). However, that approach would yield only one
30-day observation per month, limiting the number of data points. By constructing a synthetic VX30
for every trading day, we greatly increase the statistical power of our analysis. Interested readers may

30-day VIX future (VX30), constructed daily from 2005 to 2025. The blue line shows the actual VIX
Index level observed 30 days later. On average, VX30 exceeds future VIX levels, indicating a persistent
premium in VIX futures. Data source: Norgate.
Over the 2005–2025 period, the average VFRP was approximately 0.91 volatility points,
suggesting that VIX futures, on average, tend to overestimate the future level of the VIX.
However, the premium is not constant. It tends to compress or even turn negative during
episodes of elevated market stress, such as during the Global Financial Crisis (2008), the
COVID-19 shock (2020), and other volatility spikes. This mirrors the pattern observed
earlier with the Volatility Risk Premium (VRP), where the VIX overestimates realized
volatility most of the time, but not during crises.
Are the VIX Futures Risk Premium (VFRP) and the Volatility Risk Premium (VRP)
related? Figure 3 tackles the question. The scatter plot compares monthly averages
of the two series: the x-axis shows the spot VRP—the gap between the VIX and the

volatility), and the y-axis shows the VFRP (VX30 minus future VIX level). A linear regression (red

subsequent 21-day realized volatility—while the y-axis shows the VFRP, defined as the
difference between the synthetic 30-day VX30 price and the VIX level 30 days later.
A simple linear regression (red line) reveals a strong positive relationship, with an es-
timated slope of≈0.71 and an intercept of ≈−0.87. In other words, when the real-
ized VRP was large—meaning implied volatility significantly exceeded realized volatil-
ity—VIX futures also tended to embed a larger premium over the future VIX print.
This indicates that VIX futures can act as a practical, though diluted, proxy for harvest-
ing the volatility risk premium, especially for investors without access to OTC variance
swaps. However, the expected excess return is typically smaller than that of variance
swaps, reflecting the added layer of uncertainty involved in forecasting the VIX itself.
In summary, the answers to Questions 1 and 2 are both affirmative: the VIX Futures
Risk Premium (VFRP) is, on average, positive and significantly correlated with the spot
Volatility Risk Premium (VRP). While VIX futures offer an imperfect and diluted ex-
posure compared to variance swaps, they remain a practical and accessible instrument
11

for extracting—and potentially timing—the volatility risk premium, particularly for in-
vestors constrained by access or capital.
Another cornerstone of VIX futures trading is the concept of basis, often referred to as
carry . In traditional futures markets, the basis represents the price difference between the
futures contract and the spot price of the underlying asset. In the context of volatility,
it refers specifically to the gap between the VIX futures price and the VIX Index (both
observed at time t).
This difference gives rise to two important market states:
•Contango : when futures prices are above the spot VIX. This is the typical state of
the VIX term structure.
•Backwardation : when futures prices fall below the spot VIX. This usually occurs
during periods of market stress.
To illustrate the role of carry, we focus on a hypothetical constant-maturity 30-day VIX
futures contract (VX30). When holding a short exposure in such a contract to settlement,
the profit or loss over 30 calendar days decomposes into two components:
PnL t,t+30= VFRP t,t+30
= VX30 t−VIX t+30
= (VX30 t−VIX t)  
basis−(VIX t+30−VIX t)  
∆VIX(3)
The first term represents the basis or carry—the return from the futures price if it was
to converge to the initial level of the VIX Index. The second term captures the change
in the VIX itself.
To gauge how much that first term drives outcomes, we regress the 30-day VIX Futures
Risk Premium (VFRP) on the basis at trade inception:
VFRP t,t+30=α+β·(VX30 t−VIX t) +εt (4)
The regression yields a slope of 0.70 with a p-value below 1%, indicating that for every
12
--- Page 13 ---
additional volatility point of positive carry, the expected return increases by about 0.7
points. In plain English: the steeper the contango when entering the trade, the richer the
expected payoff. This suggests that the basis may be a powerful timing signal to include
in a dynamic volatility trading strategy.
Given the evidence so far, we conclude that any robust attempt to time the VIX futures
premium should incorporate information from both the expected Volatility Risk Premium
(eVRP) and the shape of the VIX futures term structure. These two components cap-
ture distinct but complementary sources of return. In the following sections, we build
our volatility trading framework precisely around this dual-signal approach, combining
insights from both concepts to generate more effective timing signals.
As you may have noticed, much of our analysis focuses on 30-day VIX futures. This is
intentional, and it provides a fitting conclusion to our brief history of volatility trading
and the evolution of related investment vehicles.
The final step that popularized volatility trading came in January 2009, when Barclays
launched the first exchange-traded notes (ETNs) linked to VIX futures. For the first time,
retail investors—with nothing more than a standard brokerage account—could gain di-
rect exposure to volatility. The flagship product was VXX, which offered long exposure
to VIX futures by tracking a rolling position in the two nearest-month VIX futures con-
tracts. Each day, at market close, the index would sell a small portion of the front-month
contract and buy more of the second-month contract, maintaining a constant average ma-
turity of approximately 30 calendar days. The note is designed to track the performance
of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index Total Return (ticker: SPVXSTR)—just
as ETFs like SPY track the S&P 500 Index.
Soon after, other volatility-linked ETNs entered the market. Products like XIV and
TVIX (from VelocityShares by Credit Suisse) introduced leverage, offering –1x inverse
(short volatility) or +2x leveraged exposure to the same VIX futures index. These prod-
ucts reset their exposure daily, making them more suitable for short-term trading than
long-term investment. Other vehicles, such as VXZ, were designed to provide exposure
to longer-dated VIX futures, appealing to investors seeking less sensitivity to short-term
volatility moves.

In Table 1, we list the main VIX ETNs currently available, including their inception
dates, leverage types, issuers,fees, and underlying benchmarks. These same benchmarks
will form the foundation for the trading strategies we’ll explore in the remainder of this
paper.
While the expansion of volatility trading into retail markets broadened participation,
it also introduced new risks—particularly for investors lacking a deep understanding of
how these products function. A dramatic example unfolded on February 5, 2018—a day
now known as Volmageddon . At the time, many investors had piled into XIV, a popu-
lar inverse volatility ETN, following several years of strong performance. Drawn by the
lure of historical returns, many retail participants failed to implement meaningful risk
management and became overexposed to a product they didn’t fully understand. When
the VIX more than doubled in a single day, VIX futures surged as well, triggering a
cascade of losses. XIV collapsed by 97% in a single session, and within two weeks, Credit
Suisse announced its termination. This event served as a sharp reminder: products tied
to volatility can themselves be highly volatile.
That said, these ETNs are not inherently flawed. When used with appropriate position
sizing and robust timing rules, they can offer an effective and accessible way to harvest
the volatility risk premium. Because they trade on exchanges with high liquidity, offer
14
--- Page 15 ---
daily cash settlement, and require no ISDA agreements,9they remain practical tools for
building diversified and decorrelated return streams, even within retail portfolios.
3 Data and Backtesting Assumptions
Before presenting the trading strategies in Section 4, we first describe the data and
assumptions that underpin all the tests in this paper. Constructing a comprehensive,
high-quality database is a critical first step for any disciplined systematic trader engaged
in backtesting or empirical research. Due to the variety of asset classes and sampling
frequencies involved, we draw on three different data sources:
•Daily price data for VIX futures, the S&P 500 Index, and the SPY ETF comes from
Norgate Data, providing a clean, survivorship-bias-free dataset extending back to
2005.
•Index-level data for the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index Total Return
(the benchmark tracked by VXX) and its inverse counterpart—the S&P 500 VIX
Short-Term Futures Inverse Daily Index (once tracked by XIV)—is sourced from
Bloomberg.
•Whenever intraday resolution is required (e.g., to compute signals near the close),
we use one-minute bar data for the SPY, VIX Index, and three-month VIX (VIX3M)
from IQFeed.
Our sample spans from January 2005 through May 2025.
Because most VIX ETNs launched well after our sample begins—and several were later
terminated, delisted, or reissued under new tickers—we construct two investable proxies
for a 30-day VIX futures exposure:
•The long volatility proxy, which we refer to as VIXLONG , starts from the S&P 500
VIX Short-Term Futures Index Total Return, then subtracts a 50 basis point annual
fee to replicate the typical drag of a real ETN.
9ISDA agreements are standardized legal contracts used in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
market. The term refers to documentation published by the International Swaps and Derivatives As-
sociation (ISDA), and they form the legal backbone of most OTC derivatives transactions between
institutions.
15
--- Page 16 ---
•The short volatility proxy, called VIXSHORT , is derived from the excess return of
the inverse index and carries an 80 basis point fee, consistent with what XIV in-
vestors were charged.
Building these proxies allows us to work with longer time series (VXX ETN became
available only in 2009) and avoid periods when ETN prices became detached from their
underlying benchmarks—most notably in March 2022, when Barclays halted the creation
of new VXX shares, causing the ETN to trade at a persistent premium to its NAV.
We have verified that, outside such dislocations, our VIXLONG andVIXSHORT proxies
track the daily returns of their corresponding listed ETNs with high precision.
Across all backtests, we assume trades are executed using market-on-closure orders (MOC)10
while signals are calculated 15 minutes earlier. This setup closely mimics real-world im-
plementation using market-on-close orders, improving realism and feasibility. We also
assume:
•Transaction costs of 5 basis points per trade,
•A 2% rebalancing threshold, to avoid unnecessary turnover and limit trading costs.
Additional details on the rebalancing mechanism are provided in later sections.
4 Strategy Definitions
In this section, we introduce and analyze four increasingly sophisticated volatility trading
strategies designed to capture the volatility risk premium. Each strategy builds on the
previous one, offering a progressive framework that evolves from a naive passive approach
into a more adaptive, data-driven model.
4.1 Passive Short Volatility (“Passive”)
We begin with the simplest possible strategy: a constant long position in VIXSHORT ,
representing 20% of the portfolio. The remaining 80% is held in cash, and we assume no
interest income is earned—making our results conservative by design.
10A market-on-close (MOC) order is an unpriced market order that is submitted before the official
exchange cutoff (typically 3:45–3:55 p.m. ET) and executed as close as possible to the end-of-day closing
auction. It guarantees execution at or near the closing price but does not allow price control.
16
--- Page 17 ---
To avoid excessive trading, the portfolio is only rebalanced when the VIXSHORT allo-
cation deviates by more than ±2 percentage points from its 20% target. For example, if
theVIXSHORT exposure drifts to 23%, we reduce the position by 3% to bring it back
to 20%. The same adjustment applies if the allocation falls below 18%.
Strategy 1: Passive
Long VIXSHORT with size = 20%
Note: Rebalance Threshold = ±2%
This passive setup serves as a baseline benchmark. It reflects the most straightforward
way of gaining persistent exposure to the volatility risk premium—without any timing
signals or predictive layers. While simple, it provides insight into the risk–reward profile
of systematically shorting volatility, including its potential and limitations.
4.2 Short Volatility with Expected VRP (“eVRP”)
The next step introduces a simple timing mechanism based on the expected Volatility
Risk Premium (eVRP). The logic is straightforward: avoid shorting volatility when the
VIX is underestimating future market volatility—that is, when realized volatility is likely
to exceed what’s implied by options prices.
But how do we estimate future realized volatility?
While there are numerous approaches—from basic historical volatility estimates to ad-
vanced high-frequency econometric models—we rely here on a simple, transparent method.
In our trading experience, sophisticated models often provide more accurate and respon-
sive forecasts, especially during high volatility environments where dynamics are nonlinear
or jumpy, but for the purposes of this paper we stick to parsimonious methods that are
easily reproducible. We encourage curious and disciplined traders to enhance this basic
framework as a natural extension.
In practice, given the autocorrelation of realized volatility and the fact that volatility
tends to cluster over time,11even a simple N-day historical standard deviation of returns
can be a useful forecast for the volatility of the next period.
11In practice, if recent volatility is high, future volatility is expected to remain high and vice versa.
17
--- Page 18 ---
To capture this, we use the standard deviation of the last 10 daily returns of SPY as
a proxy for expected volatility. The signal is computed each day at 3:45 p.m., using
intraday SPY data. The most recent return is calculated from the previous day’s close
to the current day’s 3:45 p.m. level. We then annualize the result:
eRV 30= std 10d×√
252×100 (5)
For example, if the 10-day standard deviation is 0.0071, then our estimate for the future
realized volatility (eRV 30) is:
eRV 30= 0.0071×√
252×100≈11.27% (6)
Once we have the estimate for future realized volatility (eRV 30), we can compare it with
the VIX Index at 3:45 p.m. and obtain the expected Volatility Risk Premium (eVRP):
eVRP t= VIX t−eRV 30,t
The trading logic is straightforward:
Strategy 2: eVRP
If eVRP>0:
Long VIXSHORT with size = 20%
Else:
Stay in cash
Note: Rebalance Threshold = ±2%
While this approach may improve on the static strategy, it has limitations. For example,
if markets have been quiet ahead of a major macro event, recent volatility might look
low, while the VIX is already pricing in future uncertainty. In such cases, the signal may
be misleading, and shorting volatility could be risky.
18
--- Page 19 ---
4.3 Volatility Trading using Dual Signal (“eVRP + BoC”)12
To address the limitations of relying solely on backward-looking volatility estimates,
we incorporate forward-looking information from the VIX term structure. Specifically,
we compare short-term implied volatility (VIX) with medium-term implied volatility
(VIX3M). While the VIX reflects the market’s expectation of 30-day forward volatility,
VIX3M extends that horizon to 90 days.
When VIX <VIX3M, the market expects calmer conditions in the near term than in the
medium term—suggesting no immediate stress. This is typically the case, as uncertainty
naturally increases with time. Conversely, when VIX >VIX3M, it signals rising short-
term concerns—often linked to upcoming macro events or market catalysts—implying
that the market anticipates greater volatility in the near term than in longer horizons.
We incorporate this term structure signal alongside the previously defined expected
Volatility Risk Premium (eVRP) to construct a more robust decision framework. The
intuition behind the strategy is as follows:
Strategy 3: eVRP + BoC
If eVRP>0and VIX<VIX3M:
Long VIXSHORT with size = 20%
Elseif eVRP≤0and VIX<VIX3M:
Long VIXSHORT with size = 10%
Elseif eVRP≤0and VIX>VIX3M:
Long VIXLONG with size = 20%
Else:
Stay in cash
Note: Rebalance Threshold = ±2%
This dual-signal approach allows us to combine backward-looking information (realized
volatility) with forward-looking market expectations (VIX term structure), producing a
more nuanced view of risk. It improves decision-making by identifying not just when
implied volatility appears rich or cheap, but also whether the term structure suggests
rising or easing market tension.
12BoC stands for Backwardation or Contango.
19
--- Page 20 ---
While maintaining a bias toward short volatility, the strategy is designed to quickly
shift into a long volatility position whenever the expected VRP is negative and the term
structure appears inverted (VIX >VIX3M).
4.4 Dual Signal with Dynamic Sizing (“eVRP + BoC + Sizing”)
The final refinement removes the static position size ( ±20% or 10%) and introduces dy-
namic sizing based on market conditions. The intuition is simple: the risk of shorting
volatility is not constant—it depends heavily on the current level of the VIX.
When the VIX is very low, even a modest market shock can cause a sharp volatility spike,
leading to large losses for short-volatility positions—as vividly demonstrated during the
Volmageddon event in February 2018. This situation is often described by the classic
adage: “collecting nickels in front of a steamroller” . It refers to the pattern of collecting
small, consistent gains for an extended period, only to see them wiped out by a single,
sudden shock.
Conversely, when the VIX is already high, the likelihood of it doubling again is signif-
icantly lower. High-volatility environments also tend to offer more attractive volatility
risk premiums, as fear-driven investors often overpay for protection—even when the worst
may already be behind.
To reflect this asymmetry, we scale the position size dynamically based on the level of
the VIX. The rules behind the strategies are as follow:
Strategy 4: eVRP + BoC + Sizing
If eVRP>0and VIX<VIX3M:
Long VIXSHORT with size = VIX%
Elif eVRP <0and VIX<VIX3M:
Long VIXSHORT with size = 0.5 ×VIX%
Elif eVRP <0and VIX>VIX3M:
Long VIXLONG with size = VIX%
Else:
Stay in cash
Note: Rebalance Threshold = ±2%
20
--- Page 21 ---
The signal logic remains unchanged from the previous strategy (“eVRP + BoC”): it still
combines the expected VRP with the slope of the VIX term structure to determine the
directional bias. What changes is the responsiveness of the position size, which now
adapts to the prevailing level of market volatility.
This dynamic sizing helps reduce exposure during fragile low-VIX environments while
increasing participation when volatility—and hence the risk premium—is elevated and
potentially more rewarding.
While more sophisticated position-sizing models can certainly be deployed, we delib-
erately opt for simplicity and intuition. The VIX/100 rule serves as an intuitive and
adaptable heuristic that aligns exposure with market conditions without overfitting.
Importantly, this sizing approach can be easily adjusted to reflect an investor’s individ-
ual risk tolerance. For example, a more conservative investor could divide the VIX by
200 instead of 100, effectively halving the exposure across all signals. A more aggressive
investor could use VIX/75 or VIX/50, increasing risk and potential returns proportionally.
A summary of the rules behind all four strategies is provided in Table 2.

5 Performance Results13
5.1 Passive Short Volatility (“Passive”)
Strategy TotRet CAGR Vol SR MDD Alpha Beta ρ(SPX)
Passive 185% 6.2% 14.8% 0.48 –32.0% 0.8% 0.53 71.6%
We begin with the Passive Short Volatility strategy. A constant 20% allocation to
VIXSHORT compounds at an annualized return of 6.2%, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.48
and a maximum drawdown of –32%. The strategy generates an annualized alpha of just
0.8% versus the S&P 500, and maintains a daily correlation of 72% with the market.
These figures suggest that a static short-volatility exposure using VIX ETNs is not a
particularly compelling source of alpha or diversification. It’s also worth noting that,
despite being a passive approach, the strategy still rebalanced approximately 20 times
per year on average to maintain the 20% target exposure.
5.2 Short Volatility with Expected VRP (“eVRP”)
Strategy TotRet CAGR Vol SR MDD Alpha Beta ρ(SPX)
Passive 185% 6.2% 14.8% 0.48 –32.0% 0.8% 0.53 71.6%
eVRP 219% 6.9% 13.5% 0.56 –23.5% 2.9% 0.39 58.7%
Adding the eVRP filter already changes the picture. By stepping aside when implied
volatility trades below the estimate of future realized volatility, the portfolio avoids much
of the 2008 collapse and part of the COVID-19 sell-off. By adopting this timing signal,
the strategy moved to cash on 16% of the days. CAGR rises to 6.9%, volatility decreases,
maximum drawdown improves to –24%, and the correlation to the S&P 500 drops below
60%. Annualized alpha increases to just under 3%—modest, but provides clear evidence
that even a simple timing rule adds value.14
13Each backtest incorporates transaction costs of 5 basis points and applies a 2% rebalancing threshold.
14As mentioned in the previous section, more sophisticated methods for estimating future realized
volatility can significantly improve the result of this strategy. Moreover, limiting the short only to days
when the eVRP is sufficiently above 0 may improve even further the accuracy of the model.

5.3 Volatility Trading using Dual Signal (eVRP + BoC)
Strategy TotRet CAGR Vol SR MDD Alpha Beta ρ(SPX)
Passive 185% 6.2% 14.8% 0.48 –32.0% 0.8% 0.53 71.6%
eVRP 219% 6.9% 13.5% 0.56 –23.5% 2.9% 0.39 58.7%
eVRP+BoC 464% 10.5% 12.4% 0.87 –15.2% 8.1% 0.22 35.4%
Combining the eVRP filter with a term-structure signal delivers the first significant per-
formance improvement. The eVRP + BoC variant achieves a CAGR of 10.5% and a
Sharpe ratio of 0.87, while reducing the maximum drawdown to –15%. The strategy’s
annualized alpha climbs to 8.1%, and its correlation to the S&P 500 falls to 35%. Impor-
tantly, this improvement is not the result of excessive trading: the strategy averages just
39 trades per year, meaning the performance gain is not bought at the cost of excessive
turnover. The reduction in drawdown is particularly notable, improving from –24% in
the eVRP-only version to –15% here.
Thanks to the new dual-signal framework, the strategy can now take long volatility po-
sitions—specifically when VIX>VIX3M andeVRP<0, signaling a negative expected
volatility risk premium reinforced by a negative short-term volatility outlook. Over the
full backtest, the portfolio was short volatility on 90% of the days, in cash for 6%, and
long volatility for the remaining 4%.
5.4 Dual Signal with Dynamic Sizing (“eVRP + BoC + Sizing”)
Strategy TotRet CAGR Vol SR MDD Alpha Beta ρ(SPX)
Passive 185% 6.2% 14.8% 0.48 –32.0% 0.8% 0.53 71.6%
eVRP 219% 6.9% 13.5% 0.56 –23.5% 2.9% 0.39 58.7%
eVRP+BoC 464% 10.5% 12.4% 0.87 –15.2% 8.1% 0.22 35.4%
eVRP+BoC+Sizing 1272% 16.3% 16.4% 1.00 –31.0% 15.0% 0.12 14.8%
The most striking improvement, however, comes from allowing position size to vary dy-
namically with the level of the VIX Index. When the VIX is low, the strategy reduces risk;
when it is high—at levels where another doubling is increasingly unlikely—it increases
exposure. This simple rescaling, grounded in the mean-reverting behavior of implied
23
--- Page 24 ---
volatility, boosts performance significantly: the “eVRP + BoC + Sizing” strategy earns
a CAGR of 16.3%, with a Sharpe ratio of 1 and a Sortino ratio of 1.67.
Annualized alpha reaches 15%, while beta to the equity market falls to 0.12, and corre-
lation drops to just 15%. The trade-off for this improvement is a higher level of trading
activity: the strategy averages about 80 trades per year, with an annual turnover of 736%.
The maximum drawdown increases to -31%, primarily due to a sharp give-back in 2020
following an exceptionally performance during the COVID crash. However, if drawdown
is calculated using a rolling median-adjusted NAV, which reduces the impact of tempo-
rary NAV spikes, the maximum drawdown improves to just –12%15.
A detailed summary of key performance metrics is provided in Table 3, while Figure 4
displays the cumulative equity curves for each strategy.
In conclusion, each additional layer—first the eVRP filter, then forward-looking term-
structure information, and finally volatility-scaled sizing—pushes the strategy toward a
markedly better risk-reward profile without imposing onerous trading costs. What begins
as a middling short-premium harvest ends as a high-alpha, low-beta sleeve that can stand
comfortably alongside traditional equity exposures.
The reader can explore the evolution of these improvements more closely in Appendix B,
which presents calendar-year returns for all four strategies alongside those of the S&P 500.
Looking at the results year by year reveals how each added rule progressively reshapes
the payoff profile. The basic eVRP filter helps cushion the blow from the 2008 crisis,
while the term-structure enhancement navigates the volatility spikes of 2020 with much
greater precision. Most notably, the introduction of dynamic position sizing generates a
consistent series of strong returns—highlighting how even simple, intuitive adjustments
15The adjusted maximum drawdown (MDD adj) is computed using a smoothed version of the portfolio’s
NAV. Specifically, we calculate a 20-day rolling median of the equity curve, denoted as MedianNAV t,
and then apply the standard drawdown formula to this smoothed series. The adjusted drawdown at time
tis defined as:
DDadj,t=NAV t−max(MedianNAV 1,...,t)
max(MedianNAV 1,...,t),
and the adjusted maximum drawdown, MDD adjcorresponds to the minimum of this series over the
entire backtest period. This approach provides a more robust measure of sustained losses by reducing
the influence of short-lived NAV outliers or single-day spikes, which can distort traditional drawdown
calculations.

can translate into significantly improved performance.
Introducing the volatility sleeve into a traditional passive S&P 500 allocation enhances
both risk and return. We build blended portfolios by combining SPY (100 % passive
equity) with the eVRP + BoC + Sizing strategy at weights ranging from 0 % to 100 % in
5-percentage-point steps. Each month-end we rebalance the two legs back to their targets
to neutralise intra-month compounding drift.
Figure 5 displays the Sharpe ratios of these blends. Even a modest 10–20 % allocation to
the volatility sleeve boosts the portfolio Sharpe ratio by roughly 20 %, while simultane-
ously reducing maximum drawdown and adding positive alpha.
6 Automating the Strategy via Interactive Brokers16.
Over the past decade, trading has become significantly more accessible to retail investors
thanks to two parallel developments. On one hand, a wide range of new investment ve-

hicles (such as ETFs, ETNs, and many volatility-linked products) have been launched,
offering exposure to strategies that were once reserved for institutional players. On the
other hand, advances in trading technology—particularly the rise of broker APIs like those
provided by Interactive Brokers (IBKR)—have lowered the barriers to implementing al-
gorithmic strategies, even for non-specialists. What was once the domain of institutional
desks with dedicated engineering teams can now be replicated with modest resources and
widely available tools.
To complement this paper, we have made publicly available a complete Python work-
flow that automates the execution of the eVRP + BoC + Sizing strategy via Interactive
Brokers. The notebook, source code, and setup instructions can be accessed from this
Google Colab link .
What follows is a high-level overview of the automation process. The implementation
is broken into four main steps: computing recent volatility, signal generation, position
sizing and live execution.
Step 1: Estimating Realized Volatility
To estimate short-term realized volatility, the system retrieves the last 11 daily closing
prices of SPY and updates the final value using live intraday data. Specifically, the
most recent “close” is replaced with the 15:44 ET price17, ensuring signal alignment with
market-on-close (MOC) execution. Figure 6 illustrates this data flow from raw feed to
computed volatility.
Figure 6: Volatility Calculation Pipeline: Combines daily and intraday SPY data to compute realized
volatility.
17This is the closing price of the candle that start at 15:44:00 and terminates after 60 seconds.
27
--- Page 28 ---
Step 2: Signal Generation
Using the estimated volatility and real-time data for VIX and VIX3M, the system eval-
uates which regime the market is in:
•Short volatility (High Conviction) when the expected VRP is positive and the
VIX term structure is upward sloping (VIX <VIX3M)
•Short volatility (Medium Conviction) when only the VIX term structure is
upward sloping (VIX <VIX3M)
•Long volatility when the expected VRP is negative and the term structure is
inverted (VIX >VIX3M)
•Cash otherwise
This logic mirrors the decision rules described in Section 4.4 and is exhibited in Figure 7.
Figure 7: Signal Generation Pipeline: Combines volatility and VIX structure to make allocation deci-
sions.
28
--- Page 29 ---
Step 3: Position Sizing and Rebalancing
Once a directional signal is active, position size is scaled based on the level of the VIX and
the investor’s available capital. The system checks existing positions and only submits
new orders if the desired allocation deviates beyond a user-defined threshold—typically
2%. This minimizes trading frequency and limits transaction costs, as described in our
backtests. See Figure 8 for a breakdown of this logic.
Figure 8: Position Sizing Engine: Allocations adjust with volatility and only trigger when a threshold
is crossed.

Step 4: Running the Strategy
The entire system is designed to run with minimal manual input. After launching IBKR’s
Trader Workstation (TWS) and the accompanying notebook, users simply enter:
•Market close time18
•Account equity
•Current portfolio positions
•Rebalancing threshold
Once configured, clicking Execute Strategy initiates the workflow. As long as TWS is
running and API permissions are correctly set, the system will retrieve market data,
generate trading signals, and place execution orders automatically.

7 Conclusion
In today’s financial landscape, investors are presented with an unprecedented range of
trading instruments—ETFs, ETNs, and volatility-linked products—that were not acces-
sible to previous generations. While these tools offer new opportunities, they also expose
investors to large risks. For this reason, education and the construction of a solid base of
empirical and quantitative knowledge is essential for anyone engaging with these products.
In this paper, we explore the landscape of volatility trading. We begin by offering a brief
history of how volatility became a tradable asset class, from early delta-hedging frame-
works and variance swaps to the rise of listed volatility ETNs such as VXX and XIV.
Along the way, we recall several events that marked the retail volatility trading experi-
ence—most notably the collapse of XIV during the 2018 “Volmageddon”—reminding us
that even exchange-listed instruments can carry significant structural risks.
18On early-close days, such as U.S. holidays, the signal time should be shifted to 12:45 ET with
execution at 13:00 ET.
30
--- Page 31 ---
We then explain the concept of the Volatility Risk Premium (VRP)—the persistent gap
between implied and realized volatility—and show how it relates to the VIX Futures Risk
Premium (VFRP), defined as the excess of 30-day VIX futures over the future level of
the VIX index. We discuss how contango in the VIX term structure plays a central role
in shaping the profitability of VIX futures trades and how this structure can be used as
a timing input.
The core of the paper introduces a systematic strategy that dynamically allocates expo-
sure to VIX ETNs based on simple daily signals. The model combines an estimate of
the expected VRP—calculated using a rolling 10-day realized volatility of SPY—with a
term-structure signal based on the spread between VIX and VIX3M. The final strategy
also includes dynamic position sizing proportional to the level of the VIX, reducing ex-
posure when volatility is low and increasing it when volatility (and the expected VRP)
is elevated. Despite relying only on basic statistical tools and transparent rules, this
approach delivered compelling performance: a compound annual growth rate of 16.3%
from 2008 through 2025, a Sharpe ratio of 1.00, an adjusted maximum drawdown of just
12%, an alpha of 15%, and a beta to the S&P 500 of only 0.12.
The proposed framework is deliberately kept simple and interpretable. However, it offers
multiple paths for enhancement. More sophisticated volatility forecasts could be con-
structed using high-frequency data or macroeconomic signals. The sizing mechanism,
currently based on a heuristic function of the VIX, could be refined using more sophis-
ticated methods. We leave these extensions to interested readers, confident that any
improvements they implement will bring them closer to the performance levels achieved
by many professional systematic volatility traders.
